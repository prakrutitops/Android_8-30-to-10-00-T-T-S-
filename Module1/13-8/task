I2. We have to calculate the area of a rectangle, a square and a circle. Create an abstract class
‘Shape’ with three abstract methods namely ‘RectangleArea’ taking two parameters, ‘SquareArea’ and
‘CircleArea’ taking one parameter each. The parameters of ‘RectangleArea’ are its length and breadth,
that of ‘SquareArea’ is its side and that of ‘CircleArea’ is its radius. Now create another class ‘Area’
containing all the three methods ‘RectangleArea’, ‘SquareArea’ and ‘CircleArea’ for printing the area of
rectangle, square and circle respectively. Create an object of class ‘Area’ and call all the three
methods.


I3. Write a program which will ask the user to enter his/her marks (out of 100). Define a method that
will display grades according to the marks entered as below:
Marks Grade
91-100 AA
81-90 AB
71-80 BB
61-70 BC
51-60 CD
41-50 DD
<=40 Fail


I4. Create a class named ‘Shape’ with a method to print ‘This is This is shape’. Then create two other
classes named ‘Rectangle’, ‘Circle’ inheriting the Shape class, both having a method to print ‘This is
rectangular shape’ and ‘This is circular shape’ respectively. Create a subclass ‘Square’ of ‘Rectangle’
having a method to print ‘Square is a rectangle’. Now call the method of ‘Shape’ and ‘Rectangle’ class
by the object of ‘Square’ class.
